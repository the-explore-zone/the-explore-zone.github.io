# A Brief history of Rubber

A long, long time ago, deep in the green, humming rainforests of South America, there lived a special tree called Hevea. She had shiny leaves, strong roots, and… a secret.
Whenever her bark got a little cut, she cried white, milky tears called latex.

Now, the people who lived in the forest — the clever Olmecs, Mayans, and Aztecs — discovered that these milky tears were magical.
“Look!” they said, shaping it into balls. “It bounces!”
They made balls for games, waterproof shoes for rainy days, and even coats that could laugh at the rain.

For many, many years, the magic stayed in the forest.
But one day, strangers in big wooden ships came across the ocean. Explorers like Christopher Columbus saw the bouncing balls and took some home.
In faraway Europe, people poked it, stretched it, and said,
“It’s amazing! But… it smells funny, melts in the sun, and freezes in the cold. Hmm.”

Many years passed, until a man named Charles Goodyear in America had an accident.
One day in 1839, he dropped some rubber mixed with a powdery yellow rock called sulfur onto a hot stove — and ta-da!
The rubber became tough, stretchy, and could handle the heat and cold. He called this magic trick vulcanization.

Suddenly, the world wanted rubber!
People tapped trees all over the Amazon, collecting the milky tears. Ships carried it to make tires, boots, hoses, and more.
But taking the magic from the forest wasn’t always kind. Many workers suffered while others got rich.

Then, an adventurer named Henry Wickham secretly carried thousands of seeds to faraway lands like Malaysia and Sri Lanka.
The trees grew well there, and soon most of the world’s rubber came from these sunny plantations.

In the 1900s, during big wars, countries ran out of natural rubber. Scientists rolled up their sleeves and invented synthetic rubber in laboratories — rubber without trees!

Now, cars, planes, shoes, toys, and even space rockets use a mix of both tree rubber and lab rubber.

And the Hevea tree? She still stands in her rainforest home, quietly making her bouncy, magical tears… waiting for the next curious child to discover them.
